# Objective: search for all variable stars in the perseus arm

# Insights:
# 1. values in data are brightness of each pixel from bottom to top, right to left
#    1st row is bottom row, first item is leftmost pixel
# 2. flood fill algorithm used to count the number of stars
# 3. algorithm can be modified to determine the position of the star in each image,
#    hence determining the position of the star in the night sky based on the image givens
#    (coords of the image, latitude and longitude taken, etc.)
# 4. algorithm can also be modified to determine the apparent magnitude of the stars by getting
#    the value of the brightest pixel and computing the magnitude from there via some
#    relation I have yet to determine (wala kasi yung data on this yung pixel brightnesses lang talaga ðŸ˜­)

# TODO: get the coordinates of each star in the image and see if they are in the perseus arm (search mo na lang coords nito)
